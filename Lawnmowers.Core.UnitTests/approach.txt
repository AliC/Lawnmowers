Input

	- first line initialises lawn with co-ordinates with origin 0,0
	- next lines come in pairs and relate to multiple Mowers, one pair per Mower
		- first line deploys Mower by sending a position
		- second line is a series of instructions (a simple string of letters)

	- Sequence
		- Create Lawn from co-ords (unknown source)
		- Deploy Mower from Position (unknown source)
		- for each Mower (source: remote controller)
			- navigate Mower (Instructions)


Output

	- output for each Mower should be final co-ordinates and heading
		- Status (Co-ordinates, Heading)

Nouns / Behaviours

	- Mower
	- Lawn
		- Has a Border
	- Position
		- Example: 0 0 N (x y z)
			- (x y): Co-ordinates
			- (z): Heading
	- Co-ordinates
	- Heading
		- One of N,E,S,W
	- Instructions
		- string of letters
			- one of L,R,M
	- Fleet
		- (of robotic lawnmowers)
	- Navigate
		- Mowers navigate the lawn
	- Border
		- Lawn has a Border on all sides
	- Garden
		- contains rare plants, borders lawn
	- Remote Control
		- sends Mower Instructions

My thoughts

	- Failsafe
		- Prevent Mower navigation into Gardens (don't cross the Border)
		- Prevent Mower deployment into Gardens (don't deploy past the Border)
		- responsibility should be with the lawn, not the Mower nor the remote controls

Addendum
	-	the submitted solution's design actually makes the mower responsible for Border control
		but the mower receives the border from the lawn, so the lawn provides the constraints
