Input

	- first line initialises lawn with co-ordinates with origin 0,0
	- next lines come in pairs and relate to multiple robots, one pair per robot
		- first line deploys robot by sending a position
		- second line is a series of instructions (a simple string of letters)

Output

	- output for each mower should be final co-ordinates and heading
		- Status (Co-ordinates, Heading)

Nouns

	- Robot
	- Lawn
	- Position
		- Example: 0 0 N (x y z)
			- (x y): Co-ordinates
			- (z): Heading
	- Co-ordinates
	- Heading
		- One of N,E,S,W
	- Fleet
		- (of robotic lawnmowers)
	- Navigate
		- mowers navigate the lawn
	- Border
		- lawn has a border on all sides
	- Garden
		- contains rare plants, borders lawn
	- Remote Control
		- sends robot instructions

My thoughts

	- Failsafe
		- Prevent navigation into Gardens (don't cross the border)
		- responsibility should be with the lawn, not the robots nor the remote controls
