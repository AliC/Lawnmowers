Input

	- first line initialises lawn with co-ordinates with origin 0,0
	- next lines come in pairs and relate to multiple robots, one pair per robot
		- first line deploys robot by sending a position
		- second line is a series of instructions (a simple string of letters)

	- Sequence
		- Create Lawn from co-ords (unknown source)
		- for each robot (source: remote controller)
			- deploy robot (Position)
			- navigate robot (Instructions)


Output

	- output for each mower should be final co-ordinates and heading
		- Status (Co-ordinates, Heading)

Nouns / Behaviours

My thoughts

	- Failsafe

		- Prevent robot deployment into Gardens (don't deploy past the border)
		- responsibility should be with the lawn, not the robots nor the remote controls
